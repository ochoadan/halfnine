## Understanding Scrum

Scrum is a subset of Agile, often described as "a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value." The Scrum team typically comprises three roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the Development Team.

## Quality in Scrum: An Overview

When it comes to Scrum, quality is imperative. The notion of quality in Agile software development can be bifurcated into two categories: intrinsic quality and extrinsic quality.

### Intrinsic Quality

Intrinsic quality refers to the inherent attributes of the product such as durability, reliability, uniformity, and maintainability. These aspects can be quantitatively measured through test coverage, defects escaped, or bugs per line of code.

### Extrinsic Quality

Extrinsic quality, on the other hand, is the client's perception of quality and the value they attach to it. This type of quality requires more qualitative measurement, often depending on sales, usage, or customer feedback.

## The Role of Quality Assurance (QA) Specialists

Quality Assurance (QA) specialists play a key role in ensuring the intrinsic quality of the product. They are responsible for performing verification and validation to answer two critical questions: "Are we building the product right?" and "Are we building the right product?"

---

## The Product Owner and Quality

In a Scrum team, the Product Owner is primarily responsible for optimizing the value of the work performed by the development team. This often involves making critical decisions related to both intrinsic and extrinsic quality.
For instance, the Product Owner might have to decide whether to prioritize refactoring a piece of code that has caused a significant increase in storage or to focus on implementing other value-adding features. This decision-making process often involves an in-depth analysis and discussion with the development team.
Ultimately, the Product Owner is responsible for the extrinsic quality, balancing short-term customer-facing objectives with the product’s long-term viability.

## The Scrum Team and Quality Ownership

According to the Scrum Guide, as Scrum teams mature, their definitions of 'Done' expand to include more stringent criteria for higher quality. This statement implies that the entire Scrum team owns the intrinsic type of quality.
However, in reality, ensuring quality in Agile is a shared responsibility. The Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the Development Team need to collaborate closely to deliver high-quality products.

## Quality Management in Agile

Quality management in Agile is about streamlining product quality processes, replacing homegrown applications, and resolving issues effectively throughout the entire product value chain.

---

## The Development Team's Role in Quality Ownership

The development team plays a crucial role in ensuring product quality. Without a proper product backlog and a clear understanding of each backlog item, it's impossible for the Development Team to deliver a high-quality increment.

---

## The Role of the Project Manager in Quality Assurance

In the broader context of software development, the project manager is responsible for developing quality management processes and ensuring that all products are delivered as designed.

---

## The Qualities of a Good Scrum Master

A good Scrum Master exhibits several key qualities such as excellent communication skills, responsibility, neutrality, leadership abilities, multitasking, problem-solving skills, and a deep understanding of Scrum.

---

## The Bottom Line

Most leading organizations use the Agile methodology in software development, which allows them to add stability and reliability to their products. The entire Scrum team is responsible for understanding how all requirements – both technical and functional – can bring value to clients.
