## Developers Own the Daily Scrum

Any Scrum Team developer can initiate the 15-minute Daily Scrum, a self-organizing event designed for Developers to adapt their work toward the Sprint Goal. While the Scrum Master may occasionally facilitate, it's not their main role. The Scrum Master supports the team's self-organization, ensuring the Daily Scrum occurs and benefits the developers without taking control of the meeting. This daily check-in is crucial for keeping developers on track, addressing issues, and achieving the Sprint Goal, emphasizing the importance of developer ownership for its effective use.

## The Importance of Starting the Daily Scrum

Before diving into the various approaches to starting the Daily Scrum, it's essential to understand why this event holds such significance in the Scrum methodology. The Daily Scrum serves as a platform for the development team to inspect their progress towards the Sprint Goal and make necessary adaptations to the Sprint Backlog. By conducting this meeting daily, the team can identify any issues early on and take immediate action to address them.

The prompt initiation of the Daily Scrum ensures that the meeting stays within the time-box of 15 minutes, preventing unnecessary delays and allowing team members to focus on their work. Additionally, starting the Daily Scrum on time fosters a sense of discipline and punctuality within the team, encouraging everyone to be present and actively participate in the event.

## Approaches to Starting the Daily Scrum

There are several approaches that teams can take when it comes to deciding who starts the Daily Scrum. Let's explore some of the common methods used in Agile teams:

### 1. Person Coming in Last

One approach is to have the person who arrives last initiate the Daily Scrum. This method serves as an incentive for team members to be punctual and arrive on time. By allowing the person who is late to start the meeting, it emphasizes the importance of being prompt and ensures that everyone is present before beginning the Daily Scrum.

### 2. Team Consensus

Another option is to let the development team decide who starts the Daily Scrum. This approach encourages collaboration and empowers team members to take ownership of the meeting. By collectively determining who initiates the event, it promotes a sense of shared responsibility and encourages individuals to participate actively.

### 3. Token System

A token system can also be implemented, where a designated token is passed from one team member to another to indicate who starts the Daily Scrum. This method adds a visual element to the process and ensures that everyone gets a fair chance to initiate the meeting. It can also serve as a reminder for team members to be prepared and engaged during the Daily Scrum.

### 4. Scrum Master Facilitation

While the Scrum Master's primary role is to facilitate the Scrum process, they are not necessarily the ones who should start the Daily Scrum. However, in certain situations, the Scrum Master may take on this responsibility. For example, if the team is new to Scrum or struggling with time management, the Scrum Master can initiate the meeting and guide the team towards effective collaboration.

### 5. Rotational Basis

Teams can also establish a rotational basis for starting the Daily Scrum. This method ensures that each team member gets an equal opportunity to initiate the meeting. By taking turns, team members can develop a sense of accountability and actively engage in the Daily Scrum process.

## Factors to Consider

When deciding on the approach to starting the Daily Scrum, it's essential to consider the maturity level of the team, project dynamics, and the specific needs of the organization. Each team is unique, and what works for one may not work for another. Therefore, it's crucial to experiment with different methods and adapt them to fit the team's preferences and objectives.

Regardless of the approach chosen, it is crucial to emphasize the purpose and value of the Daily Scrum to the team. The focus should be on fostering open communication, collaboration, and problem-solving rather than simply adhering to a specific starting method. The Daily Scrum is an opportunity for the team to come together, share information, and align their efforts towards achieving the Sprint Goal.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of who starts the Daily Scrum. The approach can vary depending on the team's preferences, project dynamics, and organizational context. Whether it's the person coming in last, team consensus, a token system, or the Scrum Master's facilitation, the key is to ensure that the team understands the purpose and value of the Daily Scrum. By starting the meeting promptly and engaging in open communication, the team can maximize the benefits of this essential Scrum event.
