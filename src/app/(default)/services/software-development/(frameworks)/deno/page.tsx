By default, Deno does not allow access to files, the network, or the environment without explicit permission, significantly minimizing potential security risks. This secure-by-design approach ensures that applications are safeguarded against unauthorized access and data breaches."

The runtime's security model is robust, requiring explicit permissions for access to the file system, network, and environment, which, while intended to enhance security, may not offer significant practical benefits as these permissions are typically granted at startup."
