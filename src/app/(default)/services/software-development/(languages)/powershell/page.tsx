At its core, PowerShell integrates a command-line shell with a powerful scripting language built on the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR), making every input and output a .NET object. This integration allows for a highly extensible system where users can extend the functionality through modules, resembling packages in Python or DLLs in C-Sharp."
