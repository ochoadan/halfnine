Central to this ecosystem is the Rust compiler, rustc, which efficiently compiles .rs files into binaries and other intermediate formats, ensuring high performance and security. Developers rely on Cargo, the Rust dependency manager and build tool, for managing project dependencies from sources like https://crates.io, and for utilizing its built-in test runner to execute unit tests."
